## Amazon Connect Integration for Qualtrak Evaluate

Qualtrak Evaluate by Qualtrak Solutions is a high-standard agent evaluation (quality monitoring) and online learning solution. It automatically selects recordings to be used for evaluation purposes by capturing the contact trace records (CTRs) streamed from Amazon Connect, and plays back the recording. 

This Quick Start configures resources to provide integration between Amazon Connect and Qualtrak Evaluate in a few easy steps. You can choose from three deployment options, depending on whether you already have a virtual private cloud (VPC) and data streaming set up on AWS.
